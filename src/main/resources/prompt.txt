geneate a Web UI using Html and the html should include 4 components:
1. songs selection and player
2. audio frequency visualizer
3. synced lyrics display
4. pitch graph visualizer (just build the outline)

for placement i want the
pitch graph visalizer at the top
song play at the bottom left corner and and the song selction right on top of the song player but in the same frame
the synced lyrics display placed at the bottom right corner and the audio frequency visualizer right on top of the lyrics display but in the same frame

do not give me any js / ts code yet just give me the outline

make the UI fits into one screen without needing to scroll down
for the song selection make the artist list and songs list into 2 columns with n rows but only shows 5 at default, only shows more when the user scrolls down.
when clicking on the artist a selected artist, update the songs list which performed by current selected artist
when clicking on the songs, selects a song to play and update the song player track that is now playing

Now implement the functions using JavaScript/TypeScript
For the song selection:
the default state should be no artist and song is selected likewise with the song player.
the progress bar should show the play time and indicate how long the song has been played and the timeline should be adjustable
here is the json format for returning a list of artists with endpoint http://localhost:8080/artist/all
{
    artists: [
        {
        name: xxx
        },
        {
        name: xxx
        }
        ...]
}
when clicking on the artist a selected artist, this sends a GET request with artist name selected as path variable
endpoint: http://localhost:8080/artist/{name}
then update the songs list with current artist's songs (return a list of song in Json)
the song lists should show the song duration at the left corner
{
    artists: xxx,
    songs: [
        {
           "id" : int,
          "title" : xxx,
          "duration" : int
        },
        ...]
}

when clicking on the songs, this sends a GET request with song id selected as path variable then update the song player title and artist and audiotrack
endpoint: http://localhost:8080/play/{song-id}
this returns a audio stream file eg. wav/mp3

    http://localhost:8080/play/{song_id}

    @GetMapping("/play/{song_id}")
    public void playAudio(
            @PathVariable("song_id") @Valid int songId, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

            CURRENTLY_PLAYING_ID = songId;
            streamService.streamAudio(response, songId);
    }
when the play button is clicked, play the song and update the button icon to pause
finally, add the adjust volume function

For the lyrics selection:
the default state should not have any lyrics being displayed
when a song is played, this fetch the song lyrics by sending a GET request with song id as path variable
endpoint: http://localhost:8080/lyrics/{song-id} and returns
{
    lyrics: [
        {
        text: xxx
        timestamp: int // in milliseconds
        },
        {
        text: xxx
        timestamp: int // in milliseconds
        },
        ...]
}
the lyrics should be synced with the song play time
that's all is needed for now, write me the functions in differe js/ts file seperated by the components
